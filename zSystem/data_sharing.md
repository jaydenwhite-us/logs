JCL is used to request access
to a data set. A job can
request two types of access
shared access or exclusive
access.

If shared access is allowed,
it is read only, but when
a write is required, this
becomes exclusive access.

For the remainder of
that step the job will
have exclusive accesss

This is functionally similar
to Rust the coding language
and its borrow checker.
