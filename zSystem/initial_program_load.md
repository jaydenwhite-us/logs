IPL is
when a zSystem comes to life.
The initial program load
is when all of the mappings
for input and output are loaded
into memory, and all of the
logical computers you are looking
to build are made.

So when a signal gets from point
a to point b on your z System,
what happens during
IPL will define that mapping.

When thinking of IPL
IOCDS is the most important
part to remember. IOCDS is the
Input Output Configuration
Data Set. It holds all of those
mappings.

The mappings are used to
knit together logically
defined partitions.

These LPARS
are given instructions
on how to load an operating
system. And by this point in an
IPL, you have a fully
loaded z System ready to
run transactions.
