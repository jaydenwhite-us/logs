Racf is a security system
sitting in front of
a resource.

A user request will hit
the OS which forwards
that request to a
resource manager
which forwards that request
to two layers of security
SAF and RACF.

If RACF approves that request,
it will return a resource,

This is similar to the early
versions of OAuth.
