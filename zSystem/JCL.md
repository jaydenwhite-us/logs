JCL is a way of writing
definitions
for procedures and data sets.

Main benefit of JCL is that
avoids deadlocks
by requiring data sets and
resources to be resolved
before run time.

This allows the system to make
sure a resource is available before
trying to run the job,

otherwise,
the job will fail, usually with
an error code 8 or higher.

You can check your
job logs
fix your definition
and try again.
