There are sequential datasets,
partitioned datasets,
and VASM's.

Sequential is functionally
similar to a text document;

partitioned datasets are
functionally similar to folder
with text documents;

VSAMS
take it a step further
as a VSAM can be sequential
like a text file
or indexed like like hashmap.

It can also be relative,
like an SQL database,
or linear like an In Memory
Database that can only be read
sequentially.
