Let me tell you about
the venetian bag.

A professor had a
computer with a Microsoft Word
installation that was
not autosaving.

They feared the loss of their
current research. That
information was due
in three days.

And this was their fourth or
fifth time in the office
over the course of months.

I escalated the ticket into
my queue. They said they would
come back in tomorrow. I said,
'Great, ask for Jayden
when you arrive.'

The next day I deleted one file,
restarted Word, and it was fixed.

Good God, they were elated,
they bought me a venetian bag.
Their speech for a conference
in Venice was on that laptop,
and I had saved it.

I was able
to fix their problem
because I recognized its
severity.

The promise from HR was that
Bennington would support teachers
to be practitioners, and here
the IT Department was failing
that promise.

We did not give the correct
attention to a data integrity
issue with a key piece of
software that we publicly
endorsed, on all of our machines.

And that just
wouldn't fly with me.
