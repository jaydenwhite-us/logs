The Dean's office
came to IT with a plan
to improve the student
and faculty advisor
relationships.

This program was
called First Year Forum.

It is the cornerstone
of the Bennington Curriculum.

The program
coordinates 200 people
over the course
of 18 events.

Students receive course
credit for the events
they attend.

It is the one
mandatory course in
the Bennington Curriculum.

And, I architected
this system from birth,
to launch, to long term
support.

I gathered the use cases
from a joint committee.

And I turned those into a
a real end-to-end experience.

There was a tense point.

IT wanted to use SQL databases,
and PowerBI.

But faculty wanted to use
GSuite out of familiarity.

I found we could collect
3 months of data before a
google sheet would buckle.

So, I proposed we leverage
the familiar and remain agile.
Then use PowerBI for
long term support.

The transfer was seamless.
And I opened the door
for more faculty
to train with PowerBI.
