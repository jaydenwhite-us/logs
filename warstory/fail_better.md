My biggest failure at
Bennington was an identity
management system.

People make a fractured
identity when they use
multiple services.

The plan was to knit
indentites together in
one database.

The tools were a Dynamo DB
table, Node JS software,
and SQL servers.

I architected the DynamoDB
table and the NodeJS software.

But the hand off failed.

The full time engineers
did not adopt the technology.

I think they were most
comfortable thinking
in SQL databases.

SQL is data first.
Best for separated data
and modulized reports.

NoSQL, is query first.
It is great for targeted
research. But it demands
the intent up front.

For example, my solution
found unique people that
shared the same email address.

A real problem. Because only
one of those people can
access that email.

This was a requirement of the
software that was perfectly
reflected into the database.

We fixed that. But We should
have had the foresight to fix
more.

But our intent was not sharp
enough for NoSQL. That is
what I missed.
