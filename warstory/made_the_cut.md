On my last hire,
I was the interviewer.

I spoke to
the new CIO of Bennington
about some new software for
tracking print jobs.

It was called PaperCut.

Students and faculty
Feared it meant the end of
equal printing access.

The board saw cost cutting.

The staff saw another hoop to
jump through.

And Jude, the CIO
saw Paper Cut as a
glorified measuring tool.

By this point in the interview.
He knew my majors
Saw my kindness,
And he asked
me to work on the data.

He said, "I need someone
for the passion
projects that I
don't have time to keep alive
while putting out fires."

We found that a third of
printed pages came from
10 staff users.

The data, showed us that
students were not the
cause, and we could speak
to their fears.

It also verified the
security hole PaperCut
aimed to fill. The ability to
release a job at the printer
would keep private information
private.

In the end, the college redeployed
the printers to reduce
service fees from paper jams.

This was the best solution
to support the growing
student body.

And it happened becuase I
was willing to listen and serve.
