I have a saying, "The first
time is the worst time."

And I failed my first
data engineering task.

It was an identity management
system for Bennington College.

People fracture their
identity when they use
multiple services.

And the plan was to put
the pieces together into
one database.

The tools were a Dynamo DB
table, Node JS software,
and SQL servers.

I built it. But the hand
off failed. The full time
engineers did not use it.

Post-mortem:

I think they were most
familiar with SQL databases.

SQL is data first.
Best for modulized reports.

NoSQL, is query first.
It is for targeted research
with sharp intent.

Our intent was not sharp
enough. And I missed that.

I also accidentally
embarrassed them ...in front
of their new boss.

My software identified unique
people that were given the
same email address.

This hinted
at systemic onboarding
data problems.

It let us fix one problem.
But I wish we had the
foresight and teamwork
to fix more.
