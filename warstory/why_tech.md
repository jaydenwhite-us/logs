I transitioned into broader
technology from
the music industry.

From 2011 to 2016 I was
a guitarist and music
director for three
religious programs.

This was during highschool.

I was also a tenor of my
school choir, a section
leader,

A program mentor to three
to five middle schoolers

A three time All State
Choir member,

and engaged in humanitarian
aid in the Dominican
Republic and Kampala,
Uganda.

While in Uganda playing soccer
with the students from God Cares
Orphanage, I tripped
and hurt my wrist.

Fortunately, it was only
a sprain.

Later that night a teammate said,
"I'm so glad your wrist is okay,

otherwise we wouldn't have been
able to do worship."

Their affect drove home
my belief that people failed
to imagine the more
lasting ways I use my hands.

I have always been in the
tech industry.

Music is specific technology
focused on producing aural data.

I have addressed more complex
fears and problems serving
as a data engineer than
as a tenor.
