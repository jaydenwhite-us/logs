I reduced my wife's
fuel related transportation
costs by 98% just by
switching to a more
appropriate form of travel.

In 2022, she was
working as a baker
going five miles to
and from work 5 times
a week.

I thought to myself,
that's not that
far, and we have a
network of bike
trails in the city.

What if we got a scooter?
How would that play out?

Really well in fact.
It made her warm month
travel times consistently
15 minutes.

Tea:
So consistent
she could text me, "Coming
home", and I could plan
for her arrival within
plus or minus one minute
with a cup of hot tea
ready for when she
walked in the door.

It was freaky. 'Cause
By car that commute ranged
from 20 to 45 minutes.
I'd just gotten used to having
to guess.

A car weighs about
3000lb car and the
scooter is 30lbs.

It is not often
that you can
genuinely do something
100 times better.

And it was really cool to
be able to see that
opportunity and take it.
