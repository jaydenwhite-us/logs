I reduced my wife's
fuel related transportation
costs by ninety-eight

percent by switching
to a more appropriate
form of travel.

In 2022, she was
working as a baker
going five miles to
and from work five times
a week.

I thought to myself,
that's not that
far, and we have a
network of bike
trails in the city.

What if we got an
eletric scooter?
How would that play out?

Really well in fact.

The round trip fuel cost
was four cents.

And it made her warm month
travel times consistently
15 minutes.

Tea:
So consistent
she could text me, "Coming
home", and I could plan
for her arrival within
plus or minus one minute
with a cup of hot tea
ready for when she
walked in the door.

It was radical change.
By car that commute ranged
from 20 to 45 minutes.
I'd just gotten used
to having to guess.

It is rare that you can
genuinely do something
one hundred times better.

And it was really cool
to see that opportunity
and take it.

The solution
is unconventional.
I found it because
I reframed our car problems
as "maintaining a better
transportation fleet".
