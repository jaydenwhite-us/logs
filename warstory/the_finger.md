Working in the college
woodshop. I heard a student
let out a terrible scream.

The first scream
made me turn and freeze.
The next scream we locked eyes,
and I realized she was holding
her hand where the finger should be.

Zoom. I crossed the room in
no time hit the big red,
button stop all machines.

First I needed to make sure
she didn't faint from shock,
'cause she could fall
and get a worse injury.
Second I needed to stop
or slow the bleeding.
Third I needed to
get her to help.

In less than two minutes
I'd led her from screaming to
deep breathing.

We slowed the bleeding,
She quickly stabilized
enough to go to Campus Safety.

They put her in a car
and drove her straight
to the hospital.

They couldn't re-attach the finger.

But the next day, the student came
and thanked me for acting quickly
and keeping a bad day from being
worse.
