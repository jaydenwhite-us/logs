I do perform well under
pressure.

One semester I built
an instrument, and I used
the tools in the college
woodshop to do it.

And one day a student cut
off their finger. And I
happened to be one of the
only three people there.

Their scream made me freeze.
And it did take a second to
see she was holding her hand
where her finger should be.

But then I crossed the room in
no time. Hit the big red,
button to stop every machine.

I led her from screaming to
deep breathing, so I and
the other person could get
close enough to slow the
bleeding and sit her down.

All the while staying alert
for signs of shock.

We slowed the bleeding, and
stabilized her.

The Campus Safety Team
put her in a car and drove
her straight to the hospital.

They couldn't re-attach
the finger.

But the next day, the student
thanked me for acting quickly,

and keeping a bad day from
being worse.
